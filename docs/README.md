Same frequency will be a loose close of [plug.dj](https://plug.dj)

##Minimum Viable Product

Same frequency is a web application inspired by plug.dj, a web service that enables people from across the world to groove to music together. Same Frequency will be a spin on this application that encourages people to listen to the radio together.

* Hosting on Heroku
* New account creation, login, and guest/demo login
* Chat
* Music Streaming
* Channels
* User Profiles
