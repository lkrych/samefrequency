Same frequency will be a loose clone of [plug.dj](https://plug.dj)

## Minimum Viable Product

Same frequency is a web application inspired by plug.dj, a web service that enables people from across the world to groove to music together. Same Frequency will be a spin on this application that encourages people to listen to the radio together.

It will be built using Ruby on rails and React/Redux. By the end of Week 9, this app will, at a minimum, satisfy the following criteria with smooth, bug-free navigation, and awesome CSS styling:

* Hosting on Heroku
* New account creation, login, and guest/demo login
* Chat
* Music Streaming
* Channels
* User Profiles
